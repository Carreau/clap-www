`clap` is extremely easy and intuitive to use.

After a quick glance at our [API documentation](https://docs.rs/clap) you'll be up and running in no time! If you *really* want to be up quickly, all you'll need is a completer engine (such as [racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer)), it's that simple!
